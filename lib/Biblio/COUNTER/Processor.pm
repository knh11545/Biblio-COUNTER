=head1 NAME

Biblio::COUNTER::Processor - superclass for Biblio::COUNTER processors

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # Use
    use Biblio::COUNTER::Processor;
    $processor = Biblio::COUNTER::Processor->new;
    $processor->ignore(@events);
    $report = $processor->run;

    # Subclass
    use MyProcessor;
    @MyProcessor::ISA = qw(Biblio::COUNTER::Processor);
    # Event handlers
    sub begin_report {
        my ($self, $report) = @_;
        # etc.
    }
    sub count {
        my ($self, $report, $scope, $field, $period, $val) = @_;
        # etc.
    }
    # etc.
    
=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Biblio::COUNTER::Processor> is an inheritable class that provides an
intermediate interface to L<Biblio::COUNTER|Biblio::COUNTER>.  When used on
its own, it does nothing; subclasses must define handlers for the various
events (e.g., C<begin_report> or C<count>) that are triggered as a report
is processed.

Event-handling methods (if defined) are invoked with the arguments
documented in L<Biblio::COUNTER>, except that an additional argument (the
instance of the L<Biblio::COUNTER::Processor|Biblio::COUNTER::Processor>
subclass) is prepended.

For a class that actually B<does> something when events are triggered, see
L<Biblio::COUNTER::Processor::Simple|Biblio::COUNTER::Processor::Simple>.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item B<new>

    $processor = Biblio::COUNTER::Processor->new;

Create a new processor.

=item B<run>(I<$file>)

    $report = $processor->run($what);

Process the given report.

I<$what> may be a file handle, the name of a file, or an instance of
(a subclass of) L<Biblio::COUNTER::Report|Biblio::COUNTER::Report>.

A L<Biblio::COUNTER::Report|Biblio::COUNTER::Report> object will be
instantiated and its B<process> method invoked; each time an event is
triggered, a method with the event's name (e.g., C<begin_record> or
C<cant_fix>) is invoked B<if it is defined>.  Since this class doesn't
define any such methods, the default behavior when an event is triggered is
to do nothing.

=item B<ignore>(I<@events>)

    $processor->ignore(qw/line input output/);

Specify the events to ignore.  The various events are documented in
L<Biblio::COUNTER>.

=head1 INHERITANCE

B<Biblio::COUNTER::Processor> is designed to be inheritable; in fact, it
doesn't do anything on its own (unless you count I<ignoring events> as
doing something).

=head1 BUGS

There are no known bugs.  Please report bugs to the author via e-mail
